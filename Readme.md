# Important algorithms in CPP

## Searching Algorithms in arrays
1. **Linear Search**
    -Time Complexity
     - Best case = **O(1)**
     - Average case = **O(n)**
     - Worst case = **O(n)**
   
2. **Binary Search**
    -Time Complexity
     - Best case = **O(1)**
     - Average case = **O(log n)**
     - Worst case = **O(log n)**

## Sorting Algorithms for arrays
1. **Selection Sort** - Time complexity - **O(n^2)**
    - It is in-place comparison based sorting
    - It is an unstable algorithm

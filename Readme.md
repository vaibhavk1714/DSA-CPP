# Important algorithms in CPP

## Searching Algorithms in arrays
1. **Linear Search**
       -Time Complexity
           + Best case = **O(1)**
           + Average case = **O(n)**
           + Worst case = **O(n)**
   
2. **Binary Search**
       -Time Complexity
           + Best case = **O(1)**
           + Average case = **O(n)**
           + Worst case = **O(n)**

## Sorting Algorithms for arrays
1. **Selection Sort** - Time complexity - **O(n^2)**
